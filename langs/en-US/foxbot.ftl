# General Onboarding
welcome =
    Hi, I'm { -botName }.
    
    If you use me as an inline bot, I'll mirror content from many furry sites. When I post the image I'll include a direct link and a source link, if available. You can add your Twitter account with /twitter to get content from locked accounts you follow.
    
    If you send me an image, I'll try to find the source on FA.
    
    Add me to your group for features like /mirror (where I mirror all the links in a message, including messages you reply to) or /source (where I attempt to find the source of an image you're replying to).
    
    If I'm given edit permissions in your channel, I'll automatically edit posts to include a source link.
    
    Contact my creator { -creatorName } if you have any issues or feature suggestions.

welcome-group =
    Hi, I'm { -botName }.
    
    I'm here to help with sharing images! If you use me as an inline bot, I can easily get images from most furry sites, while keeping a link to the original source.
    
    I've also got a few commands to help in groups:
    路 /mirror - I'll look at all the links in your message or the message you're replying to and mirror them
    路 /source - I'll attempt to find if the photo you're replying to has been posted on FurAffinity
    
    You can also enable automatically finding sources for images posted in here with the /groupsource command. However, I must be an administrator in the group for this to work and it can only be enabled by an administrator.
